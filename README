This project applied Bayesian hierarchical modeling to analyze the effects of ad exposure, timing, and day, on product conversion rates for the marketing data ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faviovaz/marketing-ab-testing/data)

Did the preliminary analysis to assess the influence of each feature (Frequentist approach)

Then applied Bayesian analysis on the aggregate user data by group, day, and time-section, to estimate the group-level effects and quantify uncertainty

Key features:
1. Aggregated and explored conversion data by group, day, and time-section (Allows for faster run but ignores variance in ad exposure within (group, day, section)

2. Built a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate partial pooling effects

3. Quantified uncertainty with full posterior distributions and credible intervals

4. Compared posterior predictions to observed outcomes

5. Visualized group- and cell-level conversion trends and predictive intervals

Main findings:
1. Bayesian modeling confirms group, day, and ad exposure effects on conversion.

2. Provides the best slot to choose advertising to improve the lift (coversion rate compared to the baseline)

3. Provides more interpretable and robust uncertainty estimates than frequentist methods.

4. Highlights subtle patterns and variability not seen in classical analysis.

Future improvements:
1. Add full dependency of total ad exposure for each data point to account for the variance within each  (group, day, section)

This project applies **Bayesian hierarchical modeling** to marketing A/B test data, revealing which ad exposure patterns and time slots most influence product conversions. Our analysis confirms that the total number of ads seen—and when those ads are delivered—strongly impact conversion rates, with Tuesday evenings, Monday mornings, and Sunday afternoons as the top-performing slots for advertising. Importantly, the model’s full probability distributions show that conversion rates on Friday and Saturday are consistently lower than on other days, suggesting these days are least suitable for ad campaigns. The Bayesian approach provides robust uncertainty quantification and non-trivial interaction of group with day and time slots effect.

**Project overview:**

Performed exploratory analysis using frequentist methods to assess feature influences

Aggregated user conversion data by group, day, and time-section for efficient modeling

Built a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate effects at multiple levels and quantify uncertainty

Compared model predictions against actual outcomes for validation

Identified the best time slots to advertise to optimize lift over baseline rates

Visualized conversion trends, group differences, and posterior intervals for comprehensive insights

**Main findings:**

- Bayesian modeling confirms conversion rates are significantly affected by group, day, and ad exposure

- Provides interpretable probability distributions and credible intervals for all key effects

- Reveals the most effective advertising time slots for campaign planning

- Highlights subtle behavioral patterns missed by simpler models

**Future work:**

Explore group-day interaction effects for more targeted recommendations
Extend the model to fully account for individual ad exposure variance within groups, days, and time-sections
